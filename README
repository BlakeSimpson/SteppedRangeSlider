SteppedRangeSlider is a jQuery plugin allowing creation of jQuery UI slider elements with non-linear steps.

The default jQuery UI slider step values must move in fixed steps, whilst this script allows you to define:

<pre>
Slider values (Actual scale the slider will step to) [Required]
True values (What will be populated in to your hidden fields) [Required]
Display Masks (What will be presented to the user at each step)
Display Units (A unit such as $ or % that can be shown before or after the display value)
</pre>
